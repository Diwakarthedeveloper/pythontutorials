#Short Hand in Python is we can write if else code in even less lines 

a = int(input("enter age of A\n"))
b = int(input("enter age of B\n"))


#if a>b: print("A is greater than B")

# below is if else code in one line but this reduces readibility of code 

print("B is greater than A") if a<b else print(" A is greater than B")
